# Security Audit Report

This report details the security vulnerabilities found in the Zen MCP Server repository.

## High Risk Vulnerabilities

### `test_simulation_files/api_endpoints.py`

*   **A05: Security Misconfiguration - Debug mode enabled:** The Flask application is running with `debug=True`, which can expose sensitive information in error messages.
*   **A05: Security Misconfiguration - Hardcoded secret key:** The `SECRET_KEY` is hardcoded, which is insecure. It should be loaded from an environment variable.
*   **A03: Injection - XSS vulnerability:** The `search` endpoint is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly includes user input in the HTML response without any sanitization.
*   **A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The `search` endpoint is vulnerable to SSRF because it makes a request to any URL provided by the user without any validation.
*   **A01: Broken Access Control:** The `admin_panel` endpoint has no authentication check, allowing anyone to access administrative functionality.
*   **A05: Security Misconfiguration - No file type validation:** The `upload_file` endpoint does not validate the type of file being uploaded, which could allow an attacker to upload malicious files.
*   **A03: Path Traversal:** The `upload_file` endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal because it uses the filename provided by the user to save the file, which could allow an attacker to overwrite any file on the system.
*   **A05: Security Misconfiguration - Running on all interfaces:** The Flask application is running on `0.0.0.0`, which makes it accessible from any network interface. This might not be intended.

### `test_simulation_files/auth_manager.py`

*   **A01: Broken Access Control - No proper session management:** The `AuthenticationManager` uses a simple dictionary for session management, which is not secure. It is vulnerable to session fixation and other attacks.
*   **A02: Cryptographic Failures - Weak hashing algorithm:** The `login` function uses the MD5 hashing algorithm to hash passwords, which is considered weak and is vulnerable to collision attacks.
*   **A07: Identification and Authentication Failures - Weak session generation:** The `login` function uses a weak method to generate session IDs, which makes them predictable and easy to hijack.
*   **A04: Insecure Design - No rate limiting or validation:** The `reset_password` function does not have any rate limiting or validation, which makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures - No security event logging:** The `reset_password` function does not log any security events, which makes it difficult to detect and respond to attacks.
*   **A01: Broken Access Control:** The `get_user_profile` function does not have any authorization check, allowing any user to view the profile of any other user.

## Recommendations

I will provide a separate set of instructions on how to fix these vulnerabilities.
